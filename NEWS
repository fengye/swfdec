 0.5.5 ("cps")

In time for Gnome's 2.21.4 release, here's a new Swfdec release. Features:
- rework the input handling subsystem. All objects (including sliders) can now 
  receive mouse events.
- stub all script functions and properties from Flash 8
- implement loading cross-domain policy files
- implement MovieClip.beginGradientFill (Yes, that function is big enough for 
  its own entry)
- various fixes to clipping
- Swfdec should compile and work fine on ARM architectures now
- lots of bug fixes and small features additions
- support reading text files in various formats

 0.5.4 ("2 advanced")

Features left and right make this release. Unfortunately a lot of reorganization
was necessary. In particular this release contains:
- Swfdec supports FutureSplash movies now
- rewrite GStreamer audio and video back ends. They work perfectly now and are
  the default and only enabled back ends. Other back ends are still available
  via configure switches.
- support for the TextField object. This makes YouTube show the time correctly.
- support for ActionScript exception handling and inheritance actions Cast,
  Implements, InstanceOf, Try and Throw.
- support for the MovieClipLoader object and loadMovie functions. This allows
  Flash movies to load other Flash movies.
- support for loading JPEG and PNG images.
- add an initial and incomplete implementation of the Flash security framework
- Swfdec has a logo now
- make the player automatically abort when scripts get stuck
- add PulseAudio sound output back end, it can be disabled via configure switch
- cross-compilation should now work without issues.
- lots of small improvements

 0.5.3 ("Tennis")

Lots of new built-in objects and code cleanup are the highlights of yet another
Swfdec release. And a little less condensed:
- rework of what APIs call into the script engine. This greatly simplifies using
  libswfdec in applications.
- rework invalidation handling. Less parts of the screen need to be redrawn on 
  changes, but the SwfdecPlayer::invalidate signal changed.
- support the built-in Date, XML, Sound, System.capabilities and TextFormat
  objects plus MovieClip drawing functions
- add initial support for blend modes and filters (full support is expected with
  Cairo 1.6)
- clean up initialization, video engine, sound engine and shape parsing code. 
  All the code should now be more robust, easier to read and have less broken 
  corner cases. And Swfdec supports VP6 alpha video now.
- lots of old Flash files that use Flash 4-style paths to lookup values should 
  work correctly now.
- a huge list of bugfixes and little features, see the git log for details.

 0.5.2 ("Kittencannon")

This release saw a lot of internal cleanups and only little new features. But
even that made a lot of files work and work better. Here's some detail:
- add initial support for Keyboard events. This makes quite some games work.
- add NetStream.close() functionality. This makes Youtube fullscreen work.
- export more API for debugging, like SwfdecScript and SwfdecAsDebugger.
- add new Vivified internal debugger that makes use of those.
- Swfdec can parse Flash 8 Buttons now.
- Swfdec should now set and handle all property flags correctly.
- implement LoadVars object
- make lots of native functions more correct for weird situations.
- various bugfixes, including some very visible ones. This should improve
  playback for some Flash files a lot.

 0.5.1 ("Heeeeelium")

Features! This release got some. And they even give you the long awaited 
embedded Youtube support. At the cost of lots of API changes, but who cares?
- rewrite SwfdecLoader. Add SwfdecURL support structure in the process.
- implement AsBroadcaster actionscript object.
- implement Stage actionscript object. Movies can now do the scaling themselves.
- change the HTTP in swfdec-gtk from gnome-vfs to libsoup
- add an OSS backend for non-ALSA operating systems.
- various fixes to super and DefineFunction2 flags.

 0.5.0 ("Meet Plan Party!")

Here's the long overdue update. Lots of backend stuff was rewritten. The only
thing that is missing now is more features. Expect them in the next releases.
- New and more correct script interpreter engine. The engine is even exported 
  for your coding pleasure.
- New instance placement handling algorithm. This one seems to produce much
  better correctness results than the old one.
- More ActionScript bytecodes are supported, in particular CloneSprite and
  RemoveSprite
- improve String reading in earlier Flash versions (Flash <=5 is Latin1, not 
  UTF8)
- implement some more Actionscript functions (most important is probably
  createEmptyMovieClip ())
- lots of bugfixes

 0.4.5 ("Death of the Desktop")

This is strictly a bugfix release. Have fun.
- fix linking issues on Solaris/BSD.
- fix various crashers.

 0.4.4 ("Birthday Cards")

This is a stability release. The number of new supported Flash features
is limited.
- add initial support for some tags from Flash 8 (in particular 
  DefineShape4 and PlaceObject3)
- audio and video can now be decoded with GStreamer
- add new API in the form of libswfdec-gtk for people that want to 
  include Swfdec in their applications
- improve the JPEG decoding code (less crashy, more JPEGs decoded)
- throw zzuf (http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/) at Swfdec and fix exposed
  issues
- various fixes that make writing bindings simpler
- lots of bugs fixed, including: 10551, 10629

 0.4.3 ("Your tube")

This release can play Youtube video. While this alone is enough for a 
release, this was needed to make it possible:
- add lots of new features to the script interpreter, in particular 
  support for inheritance and the Object.registerClass function.
- rework the streaming and implement the NetStream, NetConnection and
  XML script objects partially
- support passing variables to movies
- improvements to the JPEG decoder
- improvements to the debugging framework and the debugger
- support some more Flash 8 tags (in particular DefineFont3)

 0.4.2 ("Two completely different numbers")

The main change for this release is changing script execution from 
compiling to SpiderMonkey bytecode to executiong it manually. This made
it far easier and a lot more stable to run scripts. Other changes:
- Implement color transformations on images.
- Support some more ActionScript codes.
- Added swfdec_loader_get_filename() function to exported API.
- Allow compiling tests and tools without ALSA support
- Lots of bugfixes.
- Lots of new tests and debugging tools.

 0.4.1 ("Dragostea din tei")

This release introduces video features. Quite a bit of internal 
restructuring was necessary to achieve this. The API has been changed 
from 0.4.0. Changes:
- swfdec_player_iterate has been replaced by swfdec_player_advance
- some functions (like swfdec_player_set_audio_advance) have been 
  completely removed. The same effect can be achieved by using 
  swfdec_player_advance.
- Add support for video playback. This does not include scripting 
  video.
- Add native FLV support to swfdec.
- Fix the caching layer. So SWF files with lots of images no longer 
  crash swfdec.
- Lots of bugfixes.

 0.4.0 ("festivally plump")

This is the result of 3 months of refactoring, testing stuff and 
generally playing around with swfdec. I'll try to list the big 
changes:
- rip out support for outdated libart
- rip out included glib
- rework the object system to have a lot more objects
- split objects into "live" (SwfdecMovie, SwfdfecAudio), "static"
  (SwfdecCharacter) and Javascript (JSObjects)
- compile Flash Actionscript codes into SpiderMonkey bytecode
- add testsuite
- reverse engineer script execution order
- reverse engineer seeking in sprite movies
- implement lots of other Actionscript functions
- documentation for public API
- removal of all plugins (the Mozilla plugin exists as a seperate 
  package now)
- new small test application (not installed)
- slightly bigger script debugging application (not installed)

 0.3.6 ("5.11d")

This is less of a release and more of a "toss a bunch of code into
the air".  You're not going to like this release, really.  So don't
bother compiling it.  Don't even bother downloading it.  It really
just differently buggy than the last release.  Certain parts may
feel more solid, like the mozilla plugin, but the entire experience
will probably just be slower and less featureful.  I already know
there are problems, don't bother reporting them, since it will
simply remind me of how crappy this release is.  The only redeeming
factor of this release is that it doesn't crash.  Ever.  Well,
except for the bugs.  Backtraces and media files welcome.  You
could even use the handy new pop-up menu in the Mozilla plugin to
report a bug, except that I don't have the website backend running
yet.
