 * @title: SwfdecGcObject
 * @short_description: the base object type for garbage-collected objects
 *
 * This type is the basic garbage-collected object in Swfdec. It contains the
 * simple facilities for required by the garbage collector. The initial 
 * reference of this object will be owned by the context that created it and
 * will be released automatically when no other object references it anymore
 * in the garbage collection cycle.
 *
 * Note that you cannot know the lifetime of a #SwfdecGcObject, since scripts 
 * may assign it as a variable to other objects. So you should not assume to 
 * know when an object gets removed.

 * SwfdecGcObject:
 *
 * If you want to add custom objects to the garbage collection lifecycle, you

 * to provide a valid #SwfdecAsContext whenever you construct objects of this
 * type.
