The .as files, from Gnash's test suite's directory with same name, have been
imported here and compiled using the following command line, where $v is the
target version:
	cpp -x c -P -D__SWF_VERSION__=$v -I. test.as pp_test.as && \
	mtasc -version $v -header 800:600:20 -cp /usr/share/mtasc/std -cp . \
	  -swf test-$v.swf -main pp_test.as

Some files where slightly modified to make them work better on different
versions and with Swfdec's test suite. If a file has been modified, the
original file is named .as.original and modified version just .as

Tests that are not working in Swfdec yet are in pending directory and are not
included in make check

The date when the tests were last imported/updated from Gnash's CVS repository
can be found from UPDATED
