The .xml files, from Gnash's test suite's directory with same name, have been
imported here and compiled using the following command line:
	swfmill xml2swf test.xml test.swf

Most tests have been slightly modified so that they issue fscommand:quit at the
end. The unmodified version of each .xml file is available as .xml.original

The .xml files that were not imported are listed in REMOVED

Tests that are not working in Swfdec yet are in pending directory and are not
included in make check

The date when the tests were last imported/updated from Gnash's CVS repository
can be found from UPDATED
