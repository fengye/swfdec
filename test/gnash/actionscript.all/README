The .as files, from Gnash's test suite's directory with same name, have been
imported here and compiled using the following command line ($v is version):
	makeswf -v $v -r 12 -s 640x480 -o Test-$v.swf Test.as

check.as has been rewritten, so it performs a Swfdec style trace test mostly
without modifications to the test scripts. Where modifications were needed, the
original file is named .as.original and modified version just .as

Various .as files were not needed, they are listed in the REMOVED

Tests that are not working in Swfdec yet are in pending directory and are not
included in make check

Tests that are considered broken for some reason are not included. Most likely
reason is producing FAIL or XFAIL on latest Adobe's Windows player

The date when the tests were last imported/updated from Gnash's CVS repository
can be found from UPDATED
